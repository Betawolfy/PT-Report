            and has just been ported in this website to allow everyone
            to make reports easier.
            <br>However, the developper of this website has added more advices.

    <div class="container">
        <h2>Step one: Before you start.</h2>
        <p class="justify">
            Before reporting to PonyTown, your first step should be to take a screenshot if possible and if relevant.
            <br><span class="italic-text">Make sure the screenshot contains the full skin of the person.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="justify">
            <span class="italic-text">You should also</span> copy-and-paste the message you wish to report, (You only
            need to copy-and-paste one message, but others are useful)
            and to hide the user in question. (This ensures that PT staff can find the user when looking over your
            account.)
        </p>
        <p class="justify"><span class="italic-text">Tips: Copying and paste a bigger portions on message will help the staff to get
                context directly.<br> Moderators can see who you hided. Hiding the user will make it easier for them to
                find the player you're reporting.</span></p>

    <!-- Step Two: Confirming who -->
    <div class="container">
        <h2>Step two: Confirming who</h2>
        <p class="justify">
            Please make sure to tell staff your user ID listed under “Account details” In your account settings. This
            ensures that they can view the hidden people on your account.
            You will need to include the username of the hidden player you wish to report.

    <!-- Step Three: The report -->
    <div class="container">
        <h2>Step three: The report</h2>
        <p class="justify">
            You should ensure that the actions you are reporting are recent. (Reported situations from too long ago may no longer be valid)
            <br>The message quote you include in your report is used as a way of finding the relevant chat logs of the person in question, any statements and images can not be used as proof itself.
            <br><br>This is done because anyone can change their username at any given time and impersonate others, mod’s need to confirm that any situation is related to the user account you have reported and if too much time has transpired, moderators won't be able to find the chat logs they need to see.
